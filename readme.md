[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ingomohr/s-first-console-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ingomohr/s-first-console-app)

This is just a small repo to get my hands warm w/ C#.

## Topics I wanted to Cover w/ this Repo
- Setup VSCode for C#
- Typical solution layout for project and tests
- NUnit (incl parameterized tests)

## Take-Aways
- DotNet and C# can be used on macOS, too
- C# projects can be created, built, executed and debugged in VSCode
- NUnit 3.x methods need to be public (as in JUnit 4 and before)

## Links
For the repo I did some surfing and yt-ing.
So far, the best to deliver answers to my questions was:
